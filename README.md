This repository is for practicing and demonstrating the use of the GitHub MCP Server.

## GitHub MCP Server

The GitHub MCP Server is a tool that allows AI assistants and other tools to interact with GitHub's features in a structured way. It acts as a bridge between an AI (like GitHub Copilot) and your GitHub account, enabling the AI to perform actions on your behalf.

### Key Features

*   **Repository Management**: Create and manage repositories.
*   **File Operations**: Read and modify files.
*   **Branching**: Create and manage branches.
*   **Search**: Search for repositories.
*   **Issues and Pull Requests**: Interact with issues and pull requests.

### Usage

The GitHub MCP Server can be used in two ways:

*   **Local Server**: Run the server on your own machine for more control over the configuration.
*   **Remote Server**: Use the GitHub-hosted remote version for easy setup.

To use the server, you need to create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) to grant the necessary permissions.
